Dxbx compatibility
------------------

When using our own DLL, not a single game works yet.
We use Turok Evolution for testing purposes during development.

When using the Cxbx DLL, compatiblity is the same as Cxbx.

Note, that Dxbx has no controller support yet.
So even with the Cxbx DLL, you won't be able to *do* anything yet!
