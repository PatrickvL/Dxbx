Dxbx compatibility
------------------

Turok - Intro movie & start of main menu
Rayman Arena - Intro & main menu
Smashing Drive - Playable on Nvidia
Gauntlet Dark Legacy - playable, with lots of glitches

Probably a lot more, but not every game has been tested.
Also a lot of homebrew is playable.
