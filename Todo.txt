The following tasks are currently on the short-term TODO list :

- Insert a conditional for Alphaskins, so developers dont have problems with it. 

- Write a C-to-Pascal translation guide

- Translate EmuD3D8 to get some visual output of Dxbx calling actual Xbe code

- Fix the difference in contents in the .cxbxplg section between Dxbx and Cxbx (this is probably because the .xbe reading is damaged)
  (Currently this difference is only seen with Fable the Lost Chapters)

- Investigate how the HLE emulation should be translated

- Implement all API's that are implemented by Cxbx

- Determine all API's signatures that are not currently known (marked with UNKNOWN_SIGNATURE)
