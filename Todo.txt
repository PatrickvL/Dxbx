The following tasks are currently on our near-term TODO list :

- Fix the difference in contents in the .cxbxplg section between Dxbx and Cxbx (this is probably because the .xbe reading is damaged)
  (Currently this difference is only seen with Fable the Lost Chapters)

- Translate/Implement all Kernel API's that are implemented by Cxbx

- Translate all emu-patches that are implemented by Cxbx

- Translate EmuD3D8 to get some visual output of Dxbx calling actual Xbe code

- Determine all Kernel API's signatures that are not currently known (marked with UNKNOWN_SIGNATURE)

- Resolve differences between functions that end up in the same leaf, by adding extra data.
  For example, we could add the offset and value of the first fixed byte that's fixed in all functions,
  but has a unique value per function (more than one such tuple could be needed).
  
- Transform the StringTable in the Signature resource into a SuffixTree
  (which will make strings slower to read, but much more compact in storage).


ShowStoppers !!
- NTCreateFile result is returning false everytime.. so we can not acces files.
- CreateVertextshader is always use the Nop instead of other items in the case statement.
