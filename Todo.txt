The following tasks are currently on our near-term TODO list :

- Translate/Implement all Kernel API's that are implemented by Cxbx

- Translate all emu-patches that are implemented by Cxbx

- Determine all Kernel API's signatures that are not currently known (marked with UNKNOWN_SIGNATURE)

- Resolve differences between functions that end up in the same leaf, by adding extra data.
  For example, we could add the offset and value of the first fixed byte that's fixed in all functions,
  but has a unique value per function (more than one such tuple could be needed).
  
- Transform the StringTable in the Signature resource into a SuffixTree
  (which will make strings slower to read, but much more compact in storage).

- Incomplete translation of Cxbx, causin exceptions
