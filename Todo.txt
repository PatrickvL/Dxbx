The following tasks are currently on the short-term TODO list :

- Write a C-to-Pascal translation guide

- Translate EmuD3D8 to get some visual output of Dxbx calling actual Xbe code

- Fix the difference in contents in the .cxbxplg section between Dxbx and Cxbx (this is probably because the .xbe reading is damaged)

- Investigate how the HLE emulation should be translated
