	Introduction<br>
	------------<br>
	Dxbx (a Delphi port of Cxbx) is an emulator for running Xbox games on 
	Windows 2000 and higher.<br>
	Emulating a Xbox is a daunting task, so there&#39;s no guarantee that any game 
	will work.<br>
	Emulation is done by a High-Level abstraction of the Xbox system.<br>
	This means that any game that accesses the hardware directly will not work.<br>
	TODO : Start a compatibilty list<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Emulation Notes<br>
	---------------<br>
	For now, if you want to play a game with Dxbx you&#39;ll have to use the 
	CxbxKrnl in the options menu.<br>
	Copy CxbxKrnl.dll and msvcrtd.dll to your game folder and select a manual 
	folder for the output.<br>
	Place the generated default.exe into the game folder (the same location 
	where default.xbe resides).<br>
	Then press Start Emulation to start your game.<br>
	<br>
	Note, that Dxbx has not yet implemented the controller code, so apart from 
	starting a game, you won&#39;t be able to do much.<br>
	<br>
	Also, when using the CxbxKrnl, compatibility will be the same as Cxbx.<br>
	The Dxbx project implements a different function detection method, which has 
	both positive and negative consequences:<br>
	The nice thing is, that it will make it easier for us to debug non-working 
	games (so, in theory we have an easier job in supporting new games).<br>
	The down side is, that our detection method won&#39;t work with so-called 
	link-time optimized games - so we won&#39;t support those (yet).<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Prerequisites<br>
	-------------<br>
	Dxbx only runs on 32-bit Windows 2000, XP and Vista. The 64-bit versions of 
	Windows will not work due to lack of support for segmented addressing.<br>
	<br>
	Running under Linux using Wine is not tested, but it might just work. 
	(Please let us know your results!)<br>

	System requirements<br>
	-------------------<br>
	CPU: A 1Ghz Pentium or better should suffice.<br>
	Memory: Running with less than 256 MB is not recommended.<br>
	Video: TODO<br>
	Controller: TODO<br>
