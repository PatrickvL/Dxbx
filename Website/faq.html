	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: What is Dxbx?</strong></span><br>
	A: Dxbx is an Xbox1 emulator, written in the Delphi programming language.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: What&#39;s the current status of Dxbx?</strong></span><br>
	A: At the current time of writing we cannot (let me emphasize this : we 
	CANNOT) run anything yet. (It&#39;s hard work, you know.)<br>
	Of course, we&#39;ll be keeping you up-to-date of our progress in the ngemu 
	forums (http://forums.ngemu.com/dxbx-official-discussion/).<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: So Dxbx does nothing right now?</strong></span><br>
	A: Well, actually it does run Turok, although you&#39;ll have to use another 
	Xbox1 kernel DLL (see below, on Cxbx).<br>
	Also our controller code is not yet complete, so apart from a few opening 
	screens and an intro-movie, you won&#39;t be seeing much.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: Where can I download Dxbx?</strong></span><br>
	A: We&#39;re hosting the development on sourceforge 
	(http://sourceforge.net/projects/dxbx), where you can also download the 
	latest releases.<br>
	Apart from that, Shadow_tj has set up a website for Dxbx 
	(http://www.shadowtj.org/main/pages/projects/Dxbx.html) with some more 
	information that might interest you.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: I heard you need official Xbox1 SDK&#39;s 
	(Software Development Kits) from Microsoft to be able to work on Dxbx, is 
	this true?</strong></span><br>
	A: No. Actually, we don&#39;t use a single file from these SDK&#39;s (or XDK&#39;s as 
	they are frequently called).<br>
	(We do use function-patterns derived from them however, see below.)<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: Is this legal?</strong></span><br>
	A: As we&#39;re not using any classified information or restricted files, we 
	believe we&#39;re not violating any copyright or other law.<br>
	If you feel there&#39;s still a risk (or other problem) in the way we do things, 
	please tell us.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: Can Dxbx emulate an Xbox 360?</strong></span><br>
	A: No - we&#39;re building an Xbox_1_ emulator - got that?<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: Can&#39;t you start on an Xbox 360 emulator 
	instead?</strong></span><br>
	A: Yes, we could. But we won&#39;t - you could try it yourself though ;-)<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: Are there any other Xbox1 emulators?</strong></span><br>
	A: Yes, there&#39;s Xeon - the first emulator to run the Xbox1 game &#39;Halo&#39; 
	(that&#39;s about the only thing it did however, and the project is dead since).<br>
	Other projects that we know of are Xenoborg, XProject and IronBabel.<br>
	And then there&#39;s Cxbx : The only working open-source Xbox1 emulator 
	available.<br>
	As a matter of fact, Cxbx is our main source of inspiration, are we&#39;re 
	translating it&#39;s C sources to Delphi!<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: Yeah, so what is Cxbx?</strong></span><br>
	A: Read more about it on the Cxbx forum (http://forums.ngemu.com/cxbx-official-discussion/) 
	and Caustic&#39;s website (http://www.caustik.com/cxbx/index.htm).<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: What requirements does Dxbx have?</strong></span><br>
	A: For now, Dxbx requires 32 bit Windows XP (Vista and Windows 7 are not 
	tested, and might give problems).<br>
	64 Bit windows is not supported (WOW64 is not tested, but likely won&#39;t work 
	anyway).<br>
	On the hardware side, we&#39;re not completely sure yet but a decent system (2 
	Ghz CPU, 1+ GB memory and a DirectX8 compatible video card) should suffice.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: Why are you translating Cxbx to Delphi?</strong></span><br>
	A: It&#39;s fun! We can learn a lot from a project like this, and we like the 
	change of subject from our day-jobs.<br>
	Plus, it&#39;s a nice showcase for what you can accomplish with the Delphi 
	language.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: How does the emulator work?</strong></span><br>
	A: Same as Cxbx : We are building a High-Level Emulator (as opposed to a 
	Low-Level Emulator).<br>
	You could start by reading up on the various resources available on Cxbx 
	(http://www.caustik.com/cxbx/progress.htm).<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: I will, but what can you tell me about the 
	differences between HLE and LLE in a nutshell?</strong></span><br>
	A: In LLE the actual hardware is (almost) completely simulated in software.<br>
	Given enough processor power this would potentially result in a (very) good 
	level of compatibility with the actual hardware.<br>
	The problem however is, that every component of the actual Xbox1 must be 
	emulated - that&#39;s a HUGE undertaking, even when you could start with an 
	existing code-base like VirtualBox (http://www.virtualbox.org/).<br>
	HLE works by running Xbox1 software natively on Windows, by impersonating to 
	the application it&#39;s running on an Xbox1.<br>
	This requires a few tricks, and won&#39;t be able to run everything, but it&#39;s 
	enough to emulate a few (and hopefully more than a few) games.<br>
	Also, HLE is regarded as being a faster way of emulation than LLE.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: How do you impersonate an Xbox1 while 
	running on Windows XP?</strong></span><br>
	A: This involves a few steps :<br>
	1) Dxbx converts the XBE (the Xbox1 executable format) to a windows EXE<br>
	2) This EXE is statically linked to our Xbox1 kernel-replacement DLL.<br>
	3) Our kernel DLL bootstraps the game by setting up a kernel thunk table and 
	patching some library code contained in the executable with patches that 
	solve the differences between Xbox1 and Windows.<br>
	4) Once the environment is set up, we call the original entry-point of the 
	executable, effectively launching the game.<br>
	Now, hopefully we&#39;ve done enough patching to make this work!<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: What are you hoping to achieve with Dxbx?</strong></span><br>
	A: First, we are striving to achieve the same level of game-compatibility as 
	Cxbx has (see http://forums.ngemu.com/cxbx-official-discussion/95026-cxbx-compatibility-list.html 
	for details).<br>
	Once that milestone is reached, we have all intentions to improve upon it.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: What improvements are you planning for Dxbx?</strong></span><br>
	A: Well, for starters Cxbx is branched into 4 different versions already, 
	and no-one seems willing to fold it all back into one do-it-all version.<br>
	So one of our targets will be translating all the Cxbx branches into one 
	Delphi version.<br>
	Other area&#39;s of improvement are : a more complete implementation of the Xbox 
	kernel and more generic API detection.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: Are you really implementing the whole Xbox1 
	kernel again?!</strong></span><br>
	A: Yes and no - Yes, eventually we&#39;ll have to implement each and every API 
	available in the Xbox1 kernel.<br>
	But no, an actual implementation in the spirit of Wine or ReactOS is 
	normally not necessary - lots of the API&#39;s can be routed on to the Windows 
	XP kernel - that&#39;s the whole<br>
	idea of HLE!<br>
	But still, there are 379 unique API indexes in the Xbox1 kernel, so it&#39;s 
	still quite a bit of work.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: What do you mean with &#39;generic API 
	detection&#39;?</strong></span><br>
	A: Just like Cxbx, we have to do a bit of a trick to get software written 
	for the Xbox1 to run on Windows.<br>
	The main part is patching all functions that cannot run without the actual 
	hardware present (think of the DirectX API&#39;s for example).<br>
	To patch functions, we first have to locate them. Cxbx contains an ingenious 
	hand-crafted data-structure for this, but it requires an insane amount of 
	(debugging) work to achieve good results.<br>
	So in Dxbx we took another approach, and generate the needed data-structure 
	automatically, using so-called pattern-files.<br>
	This way, we get much more detailed information on the various functions 
	linked into the game - and rather effortlessly too!<br>
	Also, because we can detect the presence of named variables too, we don&#39;t 
	need any hard-coded logic to find them (like Cxbx has).<br>
	Last but not least, having a fairly detailed map of the executable gives us 
	the ability to produce stack-traces when something goes wrong (which is 
	quite helpfull when debugging a crash).<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: What can you tell me about those 
	pattern-files?</strong></span><br>
	A: Patterns (or rather: function patterns) are files that can be generated 
	with a tool called IDA Pro (http://www.hex-rays.com/idapro/flirt.htm).<br>
	Pattern files contain enough information for us to detect tens of thousands 
	of symbols (functions and variables) reliably.<br>
	If you have access to IDA Pro and an XDK version we don&#39;t have patterns for 
	yet, than please : send them to us!<br>
	(Again : not the XDK - it&#39;s just the patterns we need.)<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: Will function-patterns enable Dxbx to 
	ultimately emulate every game?</strong></span><br>
	A: Sadly, no. Some games are using link-time optimization, which means that 
	the library functions in-use do appear in the executable, but altered.<br>
	This makes it very hard for us to pin-point them. Most likely Dxbx will fail 
	placing most of the patches that should be in-place.<br>
	The effect will be undeterminable, but most likely your game will crash.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: How can I run games that use this 
	problematic link-time optimization?</strong></span><br>
	A: We know of only one way around this : use a feature-complete LLE.<br>
	None exists yet, though, so you&#39;re out of luck. Might we suggest you use an 
	actual Xbox1? ;-)<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: What about (homebrew) software using OpenXDK 
	- can that be emulated too?</strong></span><br>
	A: Quite possibly, yes. But apart from a few patterns for OpenXDK, we&#39;ve 
	written not a single patch for it, because right now our main priority is 
	emulating XDK linked software.<br>
	Once OpenXDK emulation becomes a reality, it would enable the testing Xbox1 
	homebrew on Windows, which is certainly a nice-to-have feature (in due 
	time).<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: I&#39;m trying game XYZ, but it doesn&#39;t work! 
	What now?</strong></span><br>
	A: First, check the Dxbx status (see the second Question above).<br>
	If we ever reach a state where we start running games, you might continue 
	checking if your game uses link-time optimization (this information can be 
	gleaned from an XBE dump - see below).<br>
	If that&#39;s not the case, maybe your could be made to run when we add a few 
	patches - we&#39;ll be needing your Dxbx log files to analyze exactly which 
	patches are necessary.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: Can I help Dxbx?</strong></span><br>
	A: Sure you can! Dxbx is an open-source project, so if you&#39;re a Delphi 
	programmer : Just grab our sources from sourceforge and start browsing our 
	code.<br>
	There&#39;s lots of open issues to address, so you&#39;ll surely find something nice 
	to work on.<br>
	And even when you&#39;re not a developer you could help us out by supplying us 
	with XBE dumps we don&#39;t have yet.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: What&#39;s the use of those XBE dumps?</strong></span><br>
	A: The information contained in an XBE dump mainly tells us which games use 
	what XDK version.<br>
	This gives an indication of the feasibility of actually supporting this 
	game.<br>
	Especially when it uses an XDK version that we have patterns for, there&#39;s a 
	good chance we could provide compatibility for it some day.<br>
	On the other hand : XBE dumps will also show us if a game is linked to 
	link-time optimized libraries - we&#39;ve already stated that Dxbx won&#39;t be able 
	to emulate these.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: How do I contribute an XBE dump?</strong></span><br>
	A: You can use one of these methods, all will produce compareable output:<br>
	Cxbx - Start it, open an XBE, choose menu option &quot;Edit | Dump Xbe Info To... 
	| File...&quot;<br>
	Dxbx - Start it, open an XBE, choose menu option &quot;Edit | Dump xbe info to | 
	File&quot;<br>
	XdkTracker - Start it, choose menu option &quot;File | Get XDK Info from Xbe&quot;<br>
	Now you have dumped your XBE, send the resulting file to us and we&#39;ll add it 
	to our growing archive.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: Where are you guys getting your information 
	from?</strong></span><br>
	A: Lots of information can be gleaned from the Cxbx sources. Google helps a 
	lot too.<br>
	Also, various people contribute all forms of input to us : XBE dumps, 
	documentation of Xbox internals, pattern files, etc.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="style2"><strong>Q: I have another question that&#39;s not on this 
	list, what can I do?</strong></span><br>
	A: First, try searching the Dxbx forum - there&#39;s a good chance someone 
	already talked about your topic.<br>
	If that doesn&#39;t help, post your question in a new topic, or send a PM or 
	mail to one of the Dxbx developers.<br>
