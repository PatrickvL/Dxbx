Calling conventions should be translated as follows :
	
WINAPI and NTAPI -> stdcall (see http://www.nynaeve.net/?p=42)
__fastcall -> register

When using CToPas, be aware of the following things:
" mod " -> "%" (inside strings)
" not " -> "!" (inside strings)



Converting C/C++ operators to Delphi:
	-= operator

		var1 -= var2;
		{ this equates to: }
		var1 := var1 - var2;


	+= operator

		var1 += var2;
		{ this equates to: }
		var1 := var1 + var2;
	

	&= operator

		var1 &= var2;
		{ this equates to: }
		var1 := var1 AND var2;


	|= operator
		
		var1 |= var2;
		{ this equates to: }
		var1 := var1 OR var2;


	*= operator 
	
		var1 *= var2;
		{ this equates to: }
		var1 := var1 * var2;
