
Prerequisites
-------------
To compile Dxbx you need the following :

- Any supported version of Delphi (see below)

- The latest version of the sourcecode (which you probably already have, given you're reading this)
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/dxbx
  
- Better yet, use a subversion client (we recommend TortoiseSVN) and check out the Subversion archive
  https://dxbx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/dxbx

Optional packages are:

- AlphaSkins - for skinning Dxbx (you need a license to use this)
  http://www.alphaskins.com/
  
  To enable AlphaSkins, open "src\Dxbx.inc" and remove the dot ('.') from this line:
  {.$DEFINE DXBX_USE_ALPHASKINS} // Enable this to use AlphaSkins in Dxbx


Already included are (parts of) these third party libraries :
  
- Cloothie DirectX 9 Header files - for DirectX support
  http://clootie.narod.ru/delphi/index.html
  Or use our mirror :
  http://shadowtj.net/main/pages/programming/DelphiComponents.html

- JEDI API Library - for wrappers win32 API's
  http://jedi-apilib.sourceforge.net/


Libraries needed for TranslationChecke :

- Jedi Jvcl libraries
  http://jvcl.sourceforge.net/ 


Compiling
---------

Before compiling, set the DXBXLIB environment variable to the absolute path of our Libraries folder.
For example, if you have downloaded the Dxbx sourcecode to "D:\Workspaces\SVN\Dxbx", then DXBXLIB will read : "D:\Workspaces\SVN\Dxbx\Libraries".

You can do this with the "My Computer" properties dialog - Go to the "Advanced" tab, click on "Environment Variables" and use the "New Variable" button.
Or you could start Delphi, go to "Tools", "Options", "Environment Variables" and use the "New..." button.
In either case, you should specify the variable name ("DXBXLIB") and value ("...something...\Libraries") without quotes.
Also, in both cases, Delphi must be restarted to 'see' the Environment Variable.

Then, to compile Dxbx, you got two options:

1: Open the Dxbx project group in Delphi and do a Build All. This will put new DLL's and EXE's in the Dxbx\Bin and Dxbx\Bin\Tools folders.
2: Run the Build.cmd for using want build script.


Development
-----------
All changes made to the sourcecode of Dxbx should be contributed under the GPL license!
It's best to add a GPL-header to each file to signify this fact.
For this, copy the contents of "gpl header.inc" into all new source files.

All code should conform to the Dxbx coding convention!
This is basically the Delphi standard with some extra's.
See "CodingConvention.txt" for details.

Never submit a change which breaks the build; Test first!
To guarantee the correct working of all new code, write unit-tests using DUnit. (TODO)

When working on translation of Cxbx code to Delphi, follow the translation guide!
See "Translation guide.txt" for details.


Supported Delphi versions
-------------------------
At the time of writing, these are the Delphi versions that are supported:
- Delphi 2007 Win32
To compile with other versions, we expect to need only minimal changes.
