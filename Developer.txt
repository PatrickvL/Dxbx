Tested versions of delphi
-------------------------
- Delphi 2007 Win 32


Compiling
---------

When you want to compile dxbx sources you need to following :

- Delphi version 2007 (only minimal changes needed to compile with other versions)

- The latest version of the sourcecode (which you probably already have, given you're reading this)
  Download them at http://sourceforge.net/projects/dxbx/ , or better, use the Subversion archive:
  url: https://dxbx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/dxbx
  
- Cloothie DirectX 9 Header files - for directx support
  url: http://clootie.narod.ru/delphi/index.html

  or

  url: http://shadowtj.net/main/pages/programming/DelphiComponents.html


- Alphaskins - for skins
  url: http://www.alphaskins.com/

To compile you got two options:

1: open the Dxbx project group in Delphi and do a Build All. This will put new DLL's and EXE's in the dxbx/bin and dxbx/bin/tools folders.
2: Run the Build.cmd for using want build script. ( you need alphaskins and directx9 headers have placed in the librarie folder ).


Development
-----------
All changes made to the sourcecode of dxbx should be contributed under the GPL license.
It's best to add a GPL-header to each file to signify this fact.
All code should conform to the dxbx coding convention (which is basically the Delphi standard with some extra's).
To guarantee the correct working of  all new code, write unit-tests using DUnit.
Never commit a change which breaks the build, test first!
